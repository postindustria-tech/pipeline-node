@example usageSharing/usageSharing.js

@include{doc} example-usage-sharing-intro.txt

Usage sharing is enabled by default if using some 51Degrees pipeline
builders such as the [DeviceDetectionOnPremisePipelineBuilder](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-node/blob/master/fiftyone.devicedetection.onpremise/deviceDetectionOnPremisePipelineBuilder.js)
In this example, we show how to specifically add a shareUsage element to a
Pipeline using configuration.

As with all flow elements, this can also be handled in code, using
the constructor parameters. The commented section in the example
demonstrates this.

The 51d.json file contains all the configuration options.
These are all optional, so each can be omitted if the default
for that option is sufficient:

@include usageSharing/51d.json

For details of what each setting does, see the constructor
parameters in the reference documentation for the
[share usage element](https://51degrees.com/pipeline-node/class_share_usage.html)

This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/pipeline-node/tree/master/fiftyone.pipeline.engines.fiftyone/examples/usageSharing/usageSharing.js).

Expected output
```
Constructing pipeline from configuration file.

Pipeline created with share usage element. Evidence processed
with this pipeline will now be shared with 51Degrees using the
specified configuration.
```

const core = require('fiftyone.pipeline.core');

// Note that this example is designed to be run from within the
// source repository. If this code has been copied to run standalone
// then you'll need to replace the require below with the commented
// out version below it.
const engine51 = require('../..'); // eslint-disable-line
// const engine51 = require("fiftyone.pipeline.engines.fiftyone");

console.log('Constructing pipeline from configuration file.');
console.log();

// Create a new pipeline from the supplied config file.
const pipeline = new core.PipelineBuilder().buildFromConfigurationFile('51d.json'); // eslint-disable-line

// Alternatively, the commented code below shows how to
// configure the ShareUsageElement in code, rather than
// using a configuration file.
// const usageElement = new engine51.ShareUsage({
//  sharePercentage: 0.1,
//  requestedPackageSize: 2000,
// });
// const pipeline = new core.PipelineBuilder().add(usageElement).build();

console.log(`Pipeline created with share usage element. Evidence processed 
with this pipeline will now be periodically shared with 51Degrees using the 
specified configuration.`);
