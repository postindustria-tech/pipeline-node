@example pipelines.js

This example demonstrates syncronous and asyncronous pipelines
with multiple flowElements and other core features of the 51Degrees pipeline

 */

// Note that this example is designed to be run from within the
// source repository. If this code has been copied to run standalone
// then you'll need to replace the require below with the commented
// out version below it.
const pipelineCore = require('../');
// let pipelineCore = require("fiftyone.pipeline.core");

const PipelineBuilder = pipelineCore.PipelineBuilder;

// Load in some example flowElements

// A flowElement that runs asyncronously with a sitetimeout task

const async = new (require('./flowElementsForExamples/async'))();

// A flowElement that runs syncronously which loads a different
// result if the async one has already finished processing

const sync = new (require('./flowElementsForExamples/sync'))();

// A flowElement that stops processing

const stop = new (require('./flowElementsForExamples/stop'))();

// A dummy flowElement to show that subsequent flowElements
// don't process once the flowData has been stopped
const neverRun = new (require('./flowElementsForExamples/neverRun'))();

// Build a pipeline that runs all its elements in series

const syncPipeline = new PipelineBuilder()
  .add(async)
  .add(sync)
